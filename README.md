# page
UI framework with pure OOP approach in design.  Has no unnecessary complexity: only html, css and js.

4 base things: html components/templates, css files, ui js files (ui-js), js files for generating pages from html components/templates(gen-js).

# Concept

Page represents a skeleton of every project that based on it. So it's not only UI framework. Page-cli make a copy of this repository(with changed Readme.md) and use it as a base for your application.

# Mapping between 'gen-js' and html:

It's based on [page-static-generator](https://github.com/Guseyn/page-static-generator).
